This is a small project showing how trees work and an interesting data structure based off a tree implementation. In real applications trees are stored in memory directly, but for sake of simpicity this project was made in python. 
Known bugs: collisions are sometimes straight up ignored instead of being added to the tree
Work in progress: removing all recursion within hash tree
